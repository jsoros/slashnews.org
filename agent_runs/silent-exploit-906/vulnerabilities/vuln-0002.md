# Development Server Security Vulnerabilities in Build Dependencies

**ID:** vuln-0002
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Found:** 2025-09-01 03:08:50 UTC

## Description

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the project's development dependencies that could lead to unauthorized access and data exposure during development.

1. esbuild Development Server Vulnerability
CVE Reference: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
Severity: Moderate
Affected Versions: <=0.24.2
Affected Dependencies:
- Direct: esbuild
- Indirect: through vite-node, vitest
Impact: Any website can send arbitrary requests to the development server and read responses

2. Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities
Multiple nested dependencies are affected:
```
vite (0.11.0 - 6.1.6)
└── esbuild (vulnerable)
    └── @vitest/mocker
        └── vitest
            └── vite-node (vulnerable)
```

PROOF OF CONCEPT
During development, an attacker could:
1. Create a malicious website that sends requests to the local development server
2. Read responses from the development server
3. Access potentially sensitive development data or configurations

Example attack:
```javascript
// Malicious website code
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/internal/config')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Exfiltrate development configuration
    sendToAttacker(data);
  });
```

TECHNICAL IMPACT
1. Information Disclosure:
   - Access to development configurations
   - Source code exposure
   - Environment variables leakage
   - Internal API endpoint discovery

2. Security Control Bypass:
   - CORS bypass in development
   - Development-only endpoints exposed
   - Authentication bypass in development

3. Development Environment Risks:
   - Remote code execution potential
   - Local file reading capability
   - Service worker manipulation

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Immediate Actions:
```bash
# Update dependencies with security fixes
npm audit fix --force  # Note: Contains breaking changes
```

2. Development Server Security:
- Implement strict CORS policies even in development
- Use allowlist for development server access
- Configure firewall rules for development ports
- Use HTTPS in development

3. Configuration Updates:
```javascript
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    cors: {
      origin: ['http://localhost:3000'],
      methods: ['GET', 'POST'],
      credentials: true
    },
    hmr: {
      clientPort: 24678
    }
  }
});
```

4. Long-term Fixes:
- Regular dependency audits
- Development environment isolation
- Use of development certificates
- Network segmentation for development

5. Development Practices:
- Use mock data instead of real APIs in development
- Implement separate development and production configurations
- Regular security scanning of development dependencies
- Documentation of security requirements for development

MITIGATION STEPS
1. Update all affected packages:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vite": "^7.1.2",  // Update to latest secure version
    "vitest": "^2.1.8", // Update to latest secure version
    "esbuild": "^0.24.3" // Update to patched version
  }
}
```

2. Implement development server security:
```typescript
// Development server configuration
const devServerConfig = {
  https: true,
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3000,
  cors: false,
  headers: {
    'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
    'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY'
  }
};
```

AFFECTED COMPONENTS
- Development server
- Build toolchain
- Testing infrastructure
- Local development environment

Note: While these vulnerabilities primarily affect the development environment, they could lead to serious security issues if exploited, especially in shared development environments or if development servers are accidentally exposed in staging/production environments.
