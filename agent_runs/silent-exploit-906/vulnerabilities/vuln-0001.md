# Security Configuration and Dependency Issues in Build System

**ID:** vuln-0001
**Severity:** HIGH
**Found:** 2025-09-01 03:06:58 UTC

## Description

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

Several security issues have been identified in the project's configuration and dependency management:

1. CRITICAL: Dependency Confusion Risk
- Invalid React version specification (^19.1.1) when React 19 doesn't exist
- This could lead to dependency confusion attacks if an attacker publishes a malicious package with version 19.x.x
- Impact: Potential remote code execution through malicious package installation

2. HIGH: Unsafe Dependency Version Management
- Usage of caret (^) versioning for security-critical packages
- Affected packages: axios ^1.7.7, react-dom ^19.1.1, and others
- Risk: Auto-updates could introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities
- Impact: Potential introduction of known vulnerabilities through auto-updates

3. MEDIUM: Build Configuration Weaknesses
- Relative base path ("./") in Vite config could enable path traversal
- No explicit security headers configuration in Vite
- Test environment using jsdom without explicit security boundaries
- Impact: Potential for path traversal and test environment escape

4. MEDIUM: TypeScript Configuration Risks
- skipLibCheck: true could miss type-based vulnerabilities
- Build info files stored in potentially unsafe location (node_modules/.tmp)
- No explicit Content Security Policy configurations
- Impact: Increased attack surface through missed type checking and unsafe storage

PROOF OF CONCEPT
1. Dependency Confusion:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.1.1",  // Invalid version
    "react-dom": "^19.1.1"  // Invalid version
  }
}
```

2. Unsafe Path Configuration:
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  base: "./",  // Relative path could enable traversal
})
```

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Fix Dependency Versions:
- Lock React to correct version: "react": "^18.2.0"
- Remove caret (^) from critical dependencies
- Use exact versions or range with upper bound
- Example: "axios": "~1.7.7" or "axios": "1.7.7"

2. Enhance Vite Security:
- Use absolute paths: base: '/'
- Add security headers configuration
- Implement CSP directives
- Isolate test environment properly

3. Strengthen TypeScript Security:
- Enable skipLibCheck only for specific paths
- Move tsBuildInfo to a secured location
- Add compiler options for additional security:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "allowJs": false,
      "isolatedModules": true,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    }
  }
  ```

4. Dependency Management:
- Implement lockfile security checks
- Regular dependency audits
- Use npm audit or yarn audit
- Consider using dependency scanning tools

5. Build Process Security:
- Implement integrity checks for built assets
- Add build-time security checks
- Use subresource integrity for external resources

IMPACT
The combination of these issues creates multiple attack vectors:
- Supply chain attacks through dependency confusion
- Path traversal through build configuration
- Potential test environment escape
- Missed security vulnerabilities through type checking bypass
